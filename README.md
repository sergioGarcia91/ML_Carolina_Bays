# ML Carolina Bays

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used for the analysis of Landsat-8 imagery over Carolina Bays (USA), aimed at detecting subcircular patterns (“fairy circles”) with multiple machine learning models. The preprocessed dataset used in the manuscript is publicly available on Kaggle, whereas this repository hosts all notebooks for preprocessing, model training, and result generation.
